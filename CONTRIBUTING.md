 * [Help Others](#help-others)
 * [Analyze Issues](#analyze-issues)
 * [Report an Issue](#report-an-issue)
 * [Contribute Code](#contribute-code)

## Help Others

You can help this project by helping others who use it and need answer for some questions. You will find them on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions). There is no official tag for this project yet. If you have a power to create one, feel free to do this and let us know.

## Analyze Issues

Analyzing issue reports can be a lot of effort. Any help is welcome!
Go to [the Github issue tracker](../../issues) and find an open issue which needs assistance.

## Report an Issue

If you find a defect or you have an idea for improvement you are welcome to report it.
We can only handle well-reported, actual defects, so please follow the guidelines below and use [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/tag-name) for support questions or when in doubt whether the issue is an actual defect.

Go to [the Github issue tracker](../../issues) and file an defect if you are sure about it.

### Quick Checklist for Defects Reports

Issue report checklist:
 - Real, current bug
 - No duplicates
 - Reproducible
 - Good summary
 - Well-documented
 - Minimal example

### Issue handling process

When an issue is reported, a committer will look at it and either ask for more details or close it if it is not an issue. It will be properly commented.

### Reporting Security Issues

If you find a security issue, please act responsibly and report it not in the public issue tracker, but directly to us. Go to:
- https://devportal.yaas.io/
- click on feedback button
- write down all teh details concerning the issue
- send the feedback

### Issue Reporting Disclaimer

We want to improve the quality of this project and good bug reports are welcome! But our capacity is limited, so we cannot handle questions or consultation requests and we cannot afford to ask for required details. So we reserve the right to close or to not process insufficient defect reports in favor of those which are very cleanly documented and easy to reproduce. Even though we would like to solve each well-documented issue, there is always the chance that it won't happen - remember: this is an 
Source and it comes without warranty.

## Contribute Code

You are welcome to contribute code to this project in order to fix bugs or to implement new features.

There are three important things to know:

1.  You must be aware of the Apache License (which describes contributions) and **agree to the Contributors License Agreement**. This is common practice in all major Open Source projects. To make this process as simple as possible, we are using *[CLA assistant](https://cla-assistant.io/)* for individual contributions. CLA assistant is an open source tool that integrates with GitHub very well and enables a one-click-experience for accepting the CLA. For company contributers special rules apply. See the respective section below for details.
2.  There are **several requirements regarding code style, quality, and product standards** which need to be met.
3.  Not all proposed contributions can be accepted. The code must fit the overall direction of the project and really improve it. For most bug fixes this is a given, but major feature implementation first need to be discussed with one of the projects committers (the top 20 or more of the [Contributors List](/graphs/contributors)), possibly one who touched the related code recently. The more effort you invest, the better you should clarify in advance whether the contribution fits: the best way would be to just open an enhancement ticket in the issue tracker to discuss the feature you plan to implement (make it clear you intend to contribute). We will then forward the proposal to the respective code owner, this avoids disappointment.

### Contributor License Agreement

When you contribute (code, documentation, or anything else), you have to be aware that your contribution is covered by the same [Apache 2.0 License](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0) that is applied this project.
In particular you need to agree to the Individual Contributor License Agreement,
which can be [found here](https://gist.github.com/CLAassistant/bd1ea8ec8aa0357414e8).
(This applies to all contributors, including those contributing on behalf of a company). If you agree to its content, you simply have to click on the link posted by the CLA assistant as a comment to the pull request. Click it to check the CLA, then accept it on the following screen if you agree to it. CLA assistant will save this decision for upcoming contributions and will notify you if there is any change to the CLA in the meantime.

### How to contribute - the Process

1. Make sure the change would be welcome. Best do so by proposing it in a GitHub issue.
2. Fork the project and create a new branch there.
3. Commit and push your changes on that branch. In the commit messages, specify what you were changing and provide a GitHub issue number. Issue that you created to discuss the change initially.
4. Create a Pull Request to origin repository to the master branch.
5. Follow the link posted by the CLA assistant to your pull request and accept it.
6. Wait for our code review and approval, possibly enhancing your change on request.
7. Once the change has been approved we will inform you in a comment.
8. We will close the pull request. You can remove the obsolet branch from your fork.
